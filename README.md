# React - Advanced Patterns

This project contains the implementation of the advanced react patterns presented by Kent C. Dodds in his course on https://egghead.io/courses/advanced-react-component-patterns.

The examples were implemented using TypeScript. You will find some minor differences between the implemented stories and the original examples presented in the course as I was exploring the concepts.

The best way to navigate this project is to start ny `stories/index.tsx` and trace the components and the imports of each story.

It is worth mentioning that it wasn't necessary to use PostCSS and Sass. However, this is how I usually write my style-sheets.
 
## The project supports the following technologies :

- [TypeScript](http://es6-features.org/)
- [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/)
- [PostCSS](http://postcss.org/)
- [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)

## Development

1. Install NodeJS using [brew](http://brew.sh/) on a Mac or from [the official website](https://nodejs.org/) and setup your environment.
2. Run `brew install yarn` to install yarn.
3. Run `yarn install` from the project's root directory to install the dependencies.
4. Run `yarn start` and start experimenting with your project.
